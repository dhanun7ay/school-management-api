# School Management API

This project is a **RESTful API** for managing school data, designed to facilitate adding, listing, and querying school information based on location.

### Key Features

* **List Schools:** Retrieve all schools or query schools nearest to a specified latitude and longitude.
* **Distance Calculation:** Uses the Haversine formula to calculate and sort schools by proximity.
* **Data Validation:** Input validation using Joi to ensure data integrity.
* **Modular Structure:** Organized codebase separating routes, database connection, and business logic.
* **API Testing:** Includes Postman collection with example requests and responses for easy testing.
